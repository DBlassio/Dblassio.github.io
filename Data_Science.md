<br/>In this 7-month-long diploma program, we delved into the world of data science and machine learning. We used <b>Python</b> to build sophisticated models. We explored the fundamentals of data science through building our own machine learning models from scratch. With a hands-on approach, we skillfully crafted advanced data models, applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques into a financial perspective.

The diploma program is structured into 5  modules, each paving the way for a deeper understanding of this transformative field:<br/><br/></div>
