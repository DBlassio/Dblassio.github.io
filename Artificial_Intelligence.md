**NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WITH DEEP LEARNING**

*by Dr. Christopher Manning*
- Design, implement, and understand NLP neural network models, using the Pytorch framework.
- Represent word meaning with word vectors, such as Word2Vec, SVD and GloVe.
- Identify semantic relationships between words in a sentence with dependency parsing.
- Large scale word predictions with language models, RNNs, and neural machine translation and attention.
- Pretrain transformers for more efficient natural language processing and understanding.<br>

***Libraries:** nltk, sentencepiece, Pytorch: nn.transformer, nn.linear, nn.LSTM, nn.MultiheadAttention.*
